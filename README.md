# Java Final Project Application
This program was the final project I submitted for my Java 3 class. It was a Java Maven web application project. 

# Program Functionality
This program allows users to log in to a portal and submit tickets, with the option to attach files.

The program includes several views, implemented as JSP files. The first view is the login page, where users can log in using their username and password. 
Upon successful login, users are directed to the ticket list view, which displays all the tickets they have created. 
By clicking on a specific ticket, users are redirected to the View Ticket page, which displays detailed information about the selected ticket. 

From the ticket list view, users also have a log out button or they can navigate to the Create Ticket page via a link.
In the Create Ticket view, users can input all relevant ticket details and upload attachments to create a new ticket. 
After creating the new ticket users are taken to the View Ticket page where they can review the newly created ticket. From the page users can navigate back to the ticket list view. 

The last view that I created was a sessions view which monitors which user sessions are active and shows a users last accessed time which could be useful information for admins to view.
